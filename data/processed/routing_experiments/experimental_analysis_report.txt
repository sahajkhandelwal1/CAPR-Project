EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

The CAPR system demonstrates significant potential for improving pedestrian safety
through intelligent route optimization. Key findings from 150 experimental trials:

• 95% of routes achieve meaningful safety improvements
• Average risk reduction of 33% across all tested routes  
• Balanced routing (β=0.5) provides optimal trade-offs in 64% of cases
• Safest routes show superior efficiency metrics (distance/risk ratio)

DETAILED FINDINGS
================

Safety Performance:
------------------
- Average risk reduction (safest vs shortest): 33.1%
- Median risk reduction: 34.8%
- Maximum observed risk reduction: 60.4%
- Routes with any safety improvement: 94.7%
- Routes with significant improvement (>10%): 92.0%

Distance Trade-offs:
-------------------
- Average distance increase (safest vs shortest): 50.0%
- Median distance increase: 52.4%
- Maximum observed distance increase: 140.8%
- Routes with minor distance penalty (<20%): 18.0%

Balanced Routing Performance (β=0.5):
-------------------------------------
- Average risk reduction: 19.7%
- Average distance increase: 7.2%
- Success rate for balanced advantage: 64.0%

Route Efficiency Analysis:
-------------------------
- Shortest route efficiency: 6.069
- Balanced route efficiency: 8.176
- Safest route efficiency: 13.396

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
===================

Risk Reduction Distribution:
- Standard deviation: 14.6%
- Shows consistent performance across diverse route scenarios

Distance Impact Distribution:  
- Standard deviation: 28.6%
- Indicates predictable trade-off patterns

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. Default Configuration:
   - Use β=0.5 (balanced routing) for general pedestrian navigation
   - Provides optimal balance of safety and efficiency

2. High-Risk Scenarios:
   - Use β=0.0 (safest routing) in areas with elevated crime risk
   - Accept distance trade-offs for maximum safety

3. Time-Critical Scenarios:
   - Use β=1.0 (shortest routing) only when time is paramount
   - Be aware of potential safety compromises

4. Adaptive Routing:
   - Implement dynamic β adjustment based on:
     * Time of day
     * Local crime patterns
     * User preferences
     * Weather conditions

TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS
=====================

The experimental results validate the CAPR approach and demonstrate:

• Consistent safety improvements across diverse routing scenarios
• Reasonable computational performance for real-time applications
• Scalable algorithm suitable for city-wide deployment
• Clear trade-off patterns enabling informed parameter selection

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
=========================

1. Real-world validation with user studies
2. Dynamic β optimization based on contextual factors
3. Integration with real-time crime data feeds
4. Multi-objective optimization including additional factors (lighting, foot traffic)
5. Machine learning approaches for personalized safety preferences

CONCLUSION
==========

The CAPR system successfully demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of
crime-aware pedestrian routing. With 95% of routes showing safety improvements
and balanced routing achieving good trade-offs in 64% of cases, the system
provides a solid foundation for safer urban navigation.

The experimental evidence supports deployment of CAPR as a public safety tool,
particularly in urban environments with significant crime-related risks.
