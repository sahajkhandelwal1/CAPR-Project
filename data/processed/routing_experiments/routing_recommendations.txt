CAPR ROUTING RECOMMENDATIONS
============================

Based on experimental analysis of 150 trials:

1. GENERAL USE (β = 0.5):
   • Best overall balance of safety and efficiency
   • 64% success rate for optimal trade-offs
   • Average 20% risk reduction with 7% distance increase
   • Recommended for daily pedestrian navigation

2. HIGH-RISK AREAS (β = 0.0 to 0.3):
   • Maximize safety in dangerous neighborhoods
   • Accept 30-50% distance increases for 30%+ risk reduction
   • Use at night or in areas with recent crime activity
   • Particularly effective when safety is paramount

3. TIME-SENSITIVE TRAVEL (β = 0.7 to 1.0):
   • Minimize travel time while maintaining some safety awareness
   • Use during daylight hours in familiar areas
   • Still provides 10-15% risk reduction vs pure shortest path
   • Balance urgency with reasonable safety measures

4. ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES:
   • Time of day: Lower β values (safer routes) at night
   • Weather: Adjust β based on visibility conditions
   • User profile: Allow personal safety preference settings
   • Real-time: Incorporate current crime alerts and incidents

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
• Default to β = 0.5 for new users
• Provide user controls for safety preference adjustment
• Display trade-off information (time vs safety) to users
• Consider contextual factors in β selection

The experimental evidence strongly supports CAPR deployment 
with balanced routing as the primary configuration.
